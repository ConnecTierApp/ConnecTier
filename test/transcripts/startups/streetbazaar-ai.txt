[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Nisha and Mohamed, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Nisha: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

[00:00:04] Mohamed: Yes, thanks for having us.

[00:00:06] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Nisha, tell me your background and role at StreetBazaar AI.

[00:00:11] Nisha: Sure. I’m Nisha Patel, one of the co-founders and the CEO of StreetBazaar AI. I was born in the UK but have strong ties to India. Before starting StreetBazaar, I worked as a product manager at a major e-commerce platform. My role there involved managing marketplace dynamics, user onboarding, and mobile growth strategies.

[00:00:30] Bob: That’s impressive. Mohamed, could you share your background and role as well?

[00:03:40] Nisha: On the trust-building side, we spent a lot of time on the ground, talking to vendors and understanding their needs. We also worked with local community leaders to vouch for our platform and conducted workshops to educate vendors on how to use it.

[00:03:58] Bob: That’s a great approach. What are some of the current struggles you’re facing?

[00:04:01] Nisha: One of our main struggles is finding mentorship on working with low-connectivity environments and informal economic systems. We need guidance on how to scale our platform in these challenging conditions.

[00:04:18] Mohamed: Yes, and we’re also looking for culturally fluent branding and trust-building strategies in conservative communities. We want to ensure that our platform is accepted and used by a wide range of vendors.

[00:05:22] Bob: Those are critical areas. Let’s talk about branding and trust-building strategies. What challenges are you facing in conservative communities?

[00:05:27] Nisha: In conservative communities, we need to be sensitive to cultural norms and traditions. We’re looking for strategies to build trust and credibility, such as partnering with local influencers and community leaders, and creating marketing materials that resonate with the local culture.
