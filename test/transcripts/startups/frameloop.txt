\[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Ritika, Lukas, thanks for joining today’s call.
\[00:00:02] Ritika: Hi Bob, happy to be here.
\[00:00:04] Lukas: Thanks Bob, looking forward to it.
\[00:00:06] Bob: Let’s start with introductions. Ritika, share your background and role at FrameLoop.
\[00:00:10] Ritika: Sure, I’m Ritika Anand, co-founder and Head of Product. I was a YouTube product manager for five years, leading video discovery and recommendation systems.
\[00:00:20] Bob: And Lukas?
\[00:00:22] Lukas: I’m Lukas Zimmer, co-founder and CTO. My background is in AI and ML, specifically video processing pipelines and generative models.
\[00:00:30] Bob: What inspired you to build FrameLoop?
\[00:00:33] Ritika: We saw that creators spend hours editing long-form content into bite-sized clips. They lack tools to automate highlight detection and generate engaging short-form.
\[00:00:45] Lukas: Technically, generative AI can summarize video segments, but existing tools aren’t optimized for platform-specific formats like TikTok or YouTube Shorts.
\[00:00:57] Bob: FrameLoop’s mission in one sentence?
\[00:01:00] Ritika: We enable creators to automatically produce engaging short-form content from long-form videos using generative AI.
\[00:01:07] Lukas: Our platform ingests raw footage, segments key moments, applies stylized templates, and exports ready-to-publish clips.
\[00:01:18] Bob: Who are your target users?
\[00:01:20] Ritika: Individual creators, social media agencies, and small studios focused on rapid content iteration for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.
\[00:01:32] Lukas: We also pilot with enterprise marketing teams repurposing webinars and live events.
\[00:01:40] Bob: How do you acquire these users?
\[00:01:42] Ritika: Through partnerships with creator networks, influencer agencies, and integrations with video hosting platforms like Vimeo and Wistia.
\[00:01:54] Lukas: We’ve run targeted ads on creator forums and offer free trial credits via our Chrome extension.
