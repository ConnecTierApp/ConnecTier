[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Jamila and Tobias, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Jamila: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

[00:00:04] Tobias: Yes, thanks for having us.

[00:00:06] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Jamila, tell me your background and role at Verdex Metrics.

[00:00:11] Jamila: Sure. I’m Jamila Okonkwo, co-founder and CEO of Verdex Metrics. I have a background in environmental economics and have worked extensively on climate policy and stakeholder engagement in Nigeria and across Africa. My role at Verdex is to drive business development and ensure we meet the needs of our clients while aligning with ESG regulations.

[00:00:35] Bob: That’s impressive. Tobias, could you share your background and role as well?

[00:00:38] Tobias: Of course. I’m Tobias Müller, co-founder and CTO of Verdex Metrics. I have a strong background in backend engineering, particularly in data pipelines and AWS infrastructure. I handle the technical aspects of our platform, including API design and ensuring our system integrates well with our clients' existing technologies.

[00:01:05] Bob: Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you both to launch Verdex Metrics?

[00:01:09] Jamila: Absolutely. During my work in climate policy, I noticed a significant gap in how African manufacturers were tracking and reporting their carbon emissions. Many were struggling to comply with new ESG regulations due to a lack of accessible and affordable tools. Tobias and I saw an opportunity to create a platform that could help these manufacturers monitor their emissions more effectively and meet regulatory requirements.

[00:01:40] Tobias: Yes, and from a technical standpoint, I saw the potential to leverage data pipelines and cloud infrastructure to create a scalable solution. We wanted to make it easy for manufacturers to integrate our platform with their existing systems, providing them with actionable insights to reduce their carbon footprint.

[00:02:00] Bob: And Verdex Metrics’ mission in a nutshell?

[00:02:03] Jamila: Our mission is to empower African mid-sized manufacturers with a comprehensive carbon intelligence platform that helps them monitor emissions, comply with ESG regulations, and make data-driven decisions to reduce their environmental impact.

[00:02:20] Bob: How did you build your initial prototype?

[00:02:23] Tobias: We started by identifying the key data points that manufacturers needed to track for ESG compliance. We then built a data pipeline that could collect and process this information in real-time. I used AWS services to ensure the platform was scalable and secure. Jamila worked on the user interface and ensured that the platform was intuitive and easy to use for our clients.

[00:02:50] Jamila: Yes, and we also conducted pilot tests with a few manufacturers to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process helped us refine the platform to better meet the needs of our target market.

[00:03:10] Bob: That’s a solid approach. What are some of the key features of your platform?

[00:03:14] Tobias: Our platform offers real-time emission tracking, customizable dashboards for different stakeholders, and automated reporting for ESG compliance. We also provide predictive analytics to help manufacturers identify potential areas for emission reduction and cost savings.

[00:03:40] Jamila: Additionally, we offer a stakeholder engagement module that allows manufacturers to communicate their sustainability efforts to investors, customers, and other stakeholders. This transparency is crucial for building trust and meeting regulatory requirements.

[00:04:00] Bob: It sounds like you have a robust platform. What are some of the challenges you’ve faced so far?

[00:04:04] Jamila: One of our biggest challenges has been integrating our platform with legacy ERP systems used by many manufacturers. These systems are often outdated and not designed for easy integration with modern tools. We’ve struggled to find the right expertise to navigate this challenge.

[00:04:30] Tobias: Yes, and another challenge has been understanding the nuances of green finance and how to present our impact metrics to potential investors. We need guidance on how to effectively communicate the environmental and financial benefits of our platform to secure funding.

[00:04:55] Bob: Those are common challenges for startups in your space. Let’s dive deeper into the integration issue. What specific problems have you encountered with legacy ERP systems?

[00:05:08] Tobias: The main issue is compatibility. Many of these systems use proprietary formats and protocols that make it difficult to extract and sync data with our platform. We’ve tried using middleware and custom scripts, but it’s been a time-consuming and error-prone process. We need a more streamlined approach.

[00:05:35] Jamila: Also, the manufacturers themselves are often resistant to change. They’re used to their existing systems and are hesitant to adopt new technologies, even if it means better compliance and efficiency. We need to find ways to make the transition smoother for them.

[00:06:00] Bob: Understood. On the green finance side, what aspects do you find most challenging?

[00:06:04] Jamila: The biggest challenge is understanding the criteria that investors use to evaluate green projects. We need to know what metrics they look for and how to present our data in a way that highlights our impact. Additionally, we need to navigate the complex landscape of green finance instruments and identify the ones that are most suitable for our stage of growth.

[00:06:35] Tobias: Yes, and we also need to understand the regulatory environment for green finance in different African countries. Each country has its own set of rules and incentives, and we need to tailor our approach accordingly.

[00:07:00] Bob: Those are valid points. Let’s talk about your current traction. How many manufacturers are using your platform, and what feedback have you received?

[00:07:06] Jamila: We currently have about 20 manufacturers on our platform, mostly in Nigeria and Kenya. The feedback has been largely positive. Users appreciate the real-time tracking and automated reporting features. However, we’ve received requests for more customization options and better integration with their existing systems.

[00:07:35] Tobias: Yes, and some manufacturers have also asked for more detailed analytics and recommendations on how to reduce their emissions. We’re working on enhancing our predictive analytics to meet this demand.

[00:08:00] Bob: That’s great to hear. What are your plans for scaling the platform?

[00:08:04] Jamila: Our immediate plan is to expand our user base to other African countries, particularly Ghana and South Africa. We also want to partner with more manufacturers and industry associations to increase our reach. On the technical side, we plan to enhance our data processing capabilities and introduce more advanced analytics features.

[00:09:30] Tobias: And for green finance, we’re planning to engage with financial advisors and impact investors to better understand their expectations and the available financing options. We also want to participate in industry conferences and workshops to stay updated on the latest trends and regulations in green finance.

[00:10:00] Bob: That’s a proactive approach. Let’s talk about your team. How many people do you have, and what roles are you looking to fill?

[00:10:05] Jamila: We currently have a team of 10, including developers, data scientists, and business development specialists. As we scale, we’re looking to hire more data analysts and customer success managers to support our growing user base. We also need experts in ERP system integration and green finance.

[00:10:35] Tobias: Yes, and we’re also considering bringing on a product manager to oversee the development and rollout of new features. This will help us ensure that our platform continues to meet the evolving needs of our users.

[00:11:00] Bob: That makes sense. How do you envision the role of mentors in helping you overcome your current challenges?

[00:11:05] Jamila: Mentors can provide invaluable guidance and insights based on their experience. We’re looking for mentors who have expertise in legacy system integration and green finance. Their advice can help us navigate these challenges more effectively and accelerate our growth.
