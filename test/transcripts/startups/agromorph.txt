\[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Diego, thanks for joining this call today.
\[00:00:02] Diego: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.
\[00:00:04] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Diego, tell me your background and role at AgroMorph.
\[00:00:09] Diego: Sure. I’m Diego Peña, founder and CEO of AgroMorph. I have a PhD in agronomy from Universidad Nacional Agraria in Honduras and spent seven years working on crop disease management across Latin America before starting this venture.
\[00:00:21] Bob: Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you to launch AgroMorph?
\[00:00:25] Diego: Absolutely. During my field assignments, I saw how smallholder farmers lacked early warnings for disease outbreaks. Satellite imagery and ground sensors were underutilized. I wanted to merge remote sensing and AI to give producers actionable predictions before diseases spread.
\[00:00:42] Bob: And AgroMorph’s mission in a nutshell?
\[00:00:45] Diego: We provide a remote sensing and machine learning platform that predicts crop disease outbreaks up to two weeks in advance, enabling farmers and agribusinesses to take preventative measures and reduce yield losses.
\[00:00:58] Bob: How did you build your initial prototype?
\[00:01:00] Diego: In mid-2020, I partnered with a satellite data provider to access historical NDVI and thermal imagery. I spent several months cleaning the data, then trained a random forest classifier on labeled disease event records from cooperative farms in Argentina.
\[00:01:18] Bob: How did you secure that initial dataset?
\[00:01:20] Diego: I collaborated with two agricultural cooperatives who agreed to share disease survey logs and adjacent weather station data under a pilot research agreement, in exchange for free early access to predictions.
\[00:01:35] Bob: Great. Who are your primary customers today?
\[00:01:37] Diego: Right now, we focus on mid-size agribusinesses managing large wheat and soybean operations in Brazil and Argentina. We also have an ongoing pilot with a coffee cooperative in Kenya.
\[00:01:53] Bob: How are you acquiring these customers?
\[00:01:55] Diego: Through partnerships with agricultural consultants and regional agri-insurance firms. They introduce us to their clients as part of advisory services. We’ve also done workshops at AgriTech Summit São Paulo.
\[00:02:11] Bob: And what is your pricing model?
\[00:02:13] Diego: We charge a subscription per hectare per season, with volume discounts for operations above 10,000 hectares. We include unlimited alerts and basic support, with optional premium consulting for integration.
\[00:02:27] Bob: Let’s dig into your tech stack. How does your platform work?
\[00:02:30] Diego: We ingest daily satellite imagery from Sentinel-2, weather data from public APIs, and on-site sensor feeds via LoRaWAN gateways. Our data pipeline runs in GCP using Dataflow for streaming ingestion and BigQuery for storage.
\[00:02:49] Bob: And the machine learning side?
\[00:02:51] Diego: We use a combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and gradient boosting models for prediction. We preprocess imagery to normalize for cloud cover and atmospheric effects, then feed derived indices into our models.
\[00:03:10] Bob: What challenges have you faced with data quality?
\[00:03:13] Diego: Cloud cover in tropical regions blocks up to 30% of images. We built a gap-filling algorithm using spatiotemporal interpolation and auxiliary weather data to impute missing NDVI values.
\[00:03:28] Bob: How accurate are your predictions today?
\[00:03:30] Diego: On wheat rust events, we achieve around 85% precision and 80% recall with a five-day lead time. We’re constantly refining hyperparameters and exploring LSTM sequences for better temporal context.
\[00:03:47] Bob: Are you training models in-house or using managed services?
\[00:03:50] Diego: We train in-house on GPUs spun up in GCP AI Platform. We’re exploring Vertex AI to manage pipeline orchestration and model monitoring at scale.
\[00:04:04] Bob: How about deployment? How do farmers consume predictions?
\[00:04:07] Diego: We send alerts via SMS and WhatsApp for critical warnings. We also maintain a web dashboard built in Angular that shows risk maps and recommended interventions, accessible to agronomy teams.
\[00:04:22] Bob: Do you integrate with farm management systems?
\[00:04:24] Diego: We’re integrating with FMS platforms like Granular and AgroVision via REST APIs so users can trigger spray drones or irrigation adjustments directly from their planning tools.
\[00:04:40] Bob: Let’s discuss commercialization. What are your sales channels?
\[00:04:42] Diego: Direct sales through our regional reps in Brazil and Argentina, partnerships with equipment manufacturers, and referral programs with agri-insurers who reduce premium rates when clients use our preventive alerts.
\[00:04:59] Bob: What conversion rates are you seeing from pilots to paid contracts?
\[00:05:02] Diego: About 40% of pilots convert within three months. The main barrier is demonstrating ROI on pesticide savings and yield improvements consistently.
\[00:05:17] Bob: Have you quantified ROI for customers?
\[00:05:19] Diego: Yes. In our largest pilot, a 20,000-hectare wheat farm reported a 12% reduction in fungicide usage and a 5% yield increase compared to control fields, translating to a net gain of \$120 per hectare.
\[00:05:38] Bob: Impressive. Let’s talk team and structure. How many staff do you have?
\[00:05:41] Diego: We have eight full-time team members: three data scientists, two backend engineers, one frontend developer, one agronomy specialist, and one operations manager. We contract satellite preprocessing to a third party.
\[00:06:00] Bob: What’s your burn rate and runway?
\[00:06:02] Diego: Our burn is around \$150,000 per month with six months of runway after our recent pre-seed extension. We’re being disciplined with pilot expenses and cloud costs.
\[00:06:15] Bob: Are you fundraising soon?
\[00:06:17] Diego: Yes, we plan a \$3 million Seed round in Q3 to expand our team, improve data pipelines, and support additional crops like corn and rice.
\[00:06:29] Bob: From a product standpoint, what features are top priority?
\[00:06:32] Diego: Improving the user interface with customizable alert thresholds, adding multi-crop support, and building a mobile app for on-field agronomists with offline mode.
\[00:06:46] Bob: How do you gather user feedback?
\[00:06:48] Diego: We run monthly user interviews, maintain a feature request board voted on by customers, and monitor usage metrics in Mixpanel to see which dashboards and alerts get the most engagement.
\[00:07:05] Bob: What gaps do you need mentorship on?
\[00:07:08] Diego: Technically, we need expertise on scaling GCP data pipelines and productionizing ML models with continual retraining. Commercially, we want introductions to large agribusiness executives and agri-insurance underwriters.
\[00:07:29] Bob: Any regulatory or compliance issues?
\[00:07:31] Diego: Not many in agriculture, but we’re mindful of data privacy for farm locations and yield data under Argentina’s digital rights laws and soon under Brazil’s LGPD.
