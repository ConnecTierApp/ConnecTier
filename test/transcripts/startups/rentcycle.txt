[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Tom and Emilia, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Tom: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

[00:00:04] Emilia: Yes, thanks for having us.

[00:00:06] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Tom, tell me your background and role at RentCycle.

[00:00:11] Tom: Sure thing. I’m Tom Becker, originally from Germany. I have a background in logistics and fleet management. I spent about eight years working in various roles related to fleet operations and vendor negotiations before co-founding RentCycle. Here, I handle all the on-ground deployment and operational aspects.

[00:00:30] Bob: That’s impressive. Emilia, could you share your background and role as well?

[00:00:34] Emilia: Of course. I’m Emilia Nowak from Poland. I have a master's degree in urban mobility and have worked extensively in data analysis and behavioral UX research. At RentCycle, I focus on understanding user behavior and optimizing our services based on data insights.

[00:00:55] Bob: Fantastic. Can you both share what inspired you to launch RentCycle?

[00:01:00] Tom: Absolutely. During my time in fleet management, I noticed a gap in sustainable and convenient transportation options, especially in university towns. Emilia and I met at a mobility conference and realized we shared a vision for creating a dockless bike and scooter rental service that could address this need.

[00:01:20] Emilia: Yes, and from my research, I saw how crucial it is to have reliable and eco-friendly transportation options for students and faculty. University towns are often bustling with activity, and providing a solution that reduces carbon footprint while being convenient was a win-win.

[00:01:40] Bob: That’s a great mission. How did you go about building your initial prototype?

[00:01:45] Tom: We started by securing a small fleet of bikes and scooters. I handled the logistics of getting the hardware, while Emilia focused on the tech side—developing the app and the backend system to manage rentals and track the vehicles.

[00:02:05] Emilia: Yes, the app was crucial. We needed something user-friendly that could handle payments, GPS tracking, and user feedback. We did a lot of iterative testing with a small group of users to refine the experience.

[00:02:25] Bob: That sounds like a solid foundation. How did you decide on the university towns to launch in?

[00:02:30] Emilia: We conducted market research to identify towns with a high density of students and limited public transportation options. We also looked at towns with a strong environmental consciousness, as we believed they would be more receptive to our service.

[00:02:50] Tom: Exactly. We started with a pilot program in a medium-sized university town in Poland. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, which gave us the confidence to expand to other towns across Central and Eastern Europe.

[00:03:10] Bob: That’s great to hear. Let’s talk about some of the challenges you’re facing. I understand vandalism and hardware replacement logistics are significant issues. Can you elaborate on that?

[00:03:25] Tom: Sure. Vandalism has been a bigger problem than we anticipated. We’ve had instances where bikes and scooters have been damaged or even stolen. This not only affects our operational costs but also disrupts the service for our users.

[00:03:45] Emilia: Yes, and the logistics of replacing damaged hardware is complex. We need to ensure that replacements are quick and efficient to maintain user trust and satisfaction.

[00:04:00] Bob: That’s a tough situation. Have you explored any solutions or strategies to mitigate these issues?

[00:04:08] Tom: We’ve been looking into more robust hardware designs and anti-theft measures. We’re also considering partnerships with local authorities and universities to increase surveillance and deter vandalism.

[00:04:25] Emilia: On the tech side, we’re exploring ways to use data analytics to predict high-risk areas and times for vandalism. This could help us deploy resources more effectively and reduce incidents.

[00:04:45] Bob: Those sound like solid strategies. Another area you mentioned needing help with is creating strategic partnerships with universities. Can you tell me more about that?

[00:04:55] Emilia: Absolutely. We believe that partnering with universities can provide mutual benefits. For us, it means increased visibility and credibility. For the universities, it means offering a valuable service to their students and faculty.

[00:05:15] Tom: Yes, and these partnerships can also help with the vandalism issue. Universities can provide support in terms of security and promoting responsible use of our services among students.

[00:05:35] Bob: That makes a lot of sense. Have you approached any universities yet, and if so, what has been the response?

[00:05:42] Emilia: We’ve had preliminary discussions with a few universities. The response has been positive, but we need help formalizing these partnerships and navigating the bureaucratic processes involved.

[00:06:00] Bob: I see. It sounds like you could benefit from some guidance on strategic partnerships and possibly some legal advice. Is there anything specific you’re looking for in a mentor to help with these areas?

[00:06:15] Tom: Someone with experience in negotiating partnerships and dealing with institutional bureaucracy would be invaluable. We also need advice on scaling our operations efficiently while managing costs.

[00:06:35] Emilia: Yes, and someone who understands the tech side of things, particularly data analytics and user behavior, would be great. We want to ensure our service remains user-friendly and meets the evolving needs of our users.

[00:06:55] Bob: That’s a clear set of requirements. Let’s talk about your future plans. What are your goals for RentCycle in the next year or two?

[00:07:05] Tom: Our immediate goal is to expand to at least five more university towns. We also want to improve our hardware to make it more durable and less prone to vandalism.

[00:07:25] Emilia: On the tech side, we aim to enhance our app with more features, such as real-time traffic updates and integration with other mobility services. We also want to gather more data to better understand user behavior and optimize our services.

[00:07:45] Bob: Those are ambitious but achievable goals. How do you plan to measure success in these areas?

[00:07:52] Tom: Success for us will be measured by the number of new towns we expand to, the reduction in vandalism incidents, and user satisfaction rates. We also want to see an increase in the number of rides per user.

[00:08:15] Emilia: Yes, and we’ll be tracking key metrics like app usage, user feedback, and the effectiveness of our data-driven strategies. We believe that continuous improvement based on data will be crucial to our success.

[00:08:35] Bob: That’s a comprehensive approach. Let’s switch gears a bit. Can you tell me about any notable achievements or milestones you’ve reached so far?

[00:08:45] Tom: One of our proudest moments was when we successfully launched our pilot program and saw the positive response from users. It validated our idea and gave us the confidence to move forward.

[00:09:00] Emilia: Yes, and we’ve also received some recognition in the startup community. We were featured in a local tech magazine, which helped us gain more visibility and attract potential investors.
