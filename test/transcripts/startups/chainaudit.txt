**[00:00:00] Bob:** Hello Marcus and Chen, thanks for joining this call today.

**[00:00:02] Marcus:** Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

**[00:00:03] Chen:** Yes, thank you for having us.

**[00:00:05] Bob:** Let’s start with a brief introduction. Marcus, tell me your background and role at ChainAudit.

**[00:00:10] Marcus:** Sure. I’m Marcus White, co-founder and CEO of ChainAudit. I have a background in financial compliance and risk frameworks, having worked as an auditor at Deloitte for several years. My role at ChainAudit is to oversee the strategic direction and ensure we meet all regulatory and compliance standards.

**[00:00:30] Bob:** That’s impressive. Chen, could you share your background and role as well?

**[00:00:35] Chen:** Of course. I’m Chen Zhao, co-founder and CTO of ChainAudit. I specialize in smart contract security, transaction graph analysis, and DeFi tooling. Before ChainAudit, I worked on various blockchain projects, focusing on security and decentralized finance protocols.

**[00:00:55] Bob:** Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you to launch ChainAudit?

**[00:01:00] Marcus:** Absolutely. During my time at Deloitte, I saw firsthand the challenges in auditing blockchain-based systems. Traditional methods were inadequate, and there was a clear need for automated solutions that could handle the complexity and scale of decentralized finance. Chen and I met at a blockchain conference, and we realized our skills complemented each other perfectly.

**[00:01:30] Chen:** Yes, I had been working on smart contract security and saw the same gaps. We decided to combine our expertise to create an automated blockchain auditing service that could provide reliable and efficient audits for DAOs and DeFi protocols.

**[00:01:50] Bob:** And ChainAudit’s mission in a nutshell?

**[00:01:55] Marcus:** Our mission is to provide automated, secure, and transparent blockchain auditing services. We aim to build trust in the decentralized finance ecosystem by ensuring that DAOs and DeFi protocols are compliant and secure.

**[00:02:15] Bob:** How did you build your initial prototype?

**[00:02:20] Chen:** We started by identifying the key pain points in manual blockchain audits. We then developed algorithms to automate the detection of common vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We used Solidity for smart contract security and integrated transaction graph analysis to monitor and analyze blockchain data.

**[00:02:50] Marcus:** On the compliance side, we created risk frameworks that could be automated and integrated into our platform. This ensured that our audits were not only technically sound but also met regulatory requirements.

**[00:03:10] Bob:** That’s a solid foundation. What are some of the key features of your platform?

**[00:03:15] Chen:** Our platform offers automated smart contract audits, real-time transaction monitoring, and comprehensive risk assessments. We also provide detailed reports that highlight potential vulnerabilities and compliance issues, along with recommendations for remediation.

**[00:03:40] Marcus:** Additionally, we have a user-friendly dashboard that allows clients to track the status of their audits and view historical data. This transparency is crucial for building trust with our clients.

**[00:04:00] Bob:** How do you ensure the security and reliability of your audits?

**[00:04:05] Chen:** We employ multiple layers of security, including encryption, secure data storage, and regular penetration testing. Our algorithms are continuously updated to address new threats and vulnerabilities. We also have a team of experts who manually review critical findings to ensure accuracy.

**[00:04:35] Marcus:** On the compliance side, we stay updated with the latest regulatory changes and integrate them into our risk frameworks. This ensures that our audits are always in line with current standards.

**[00:04:55] Bob:** That’s reassuring. Let’s talk about your current struggles. What are the biggest challenges you’re facing?

**[00:05:00] Marcus:** One of our main challenges is finding effective go-to-market strategies in a saturated crypto market. There are many players offering similar services, and standing out is tough. We need to differentiate ourselves and communicate our unique value proposition clearly.

**[00:05:30] Chen:** Another challenge is marketing our technical credibility to non-technical stakeholders. While we have strong technical capabilities, conveying this to potential clients who may not understand the intricacies of blockchain technology is difficult.

**[00:05:55] Bob:** Those are common challenges for startups in the blockchain space. How are you currently addressing these issues?

**[00:06:00] Marcus:** We’re focusing on building case studies and testimonials from our existing clients to showcase our success stories. We’re also exploring partnerships with other companies in the ecosystem to expand our reach and credibility.

**[00:06:30] Chen:** On the technical side, we’re creating educational content and webinars to demystify blockchain auditing for non-technical audiences. We believe that educating our potential clients will help them understand the value we bring.

**[00:06:55] Bob:** That’s a good start. Have you considered any specific marketing strategies or channels that you think could be effective?

**[00:07:00] Marcus:** We’re looking into content marketing, particularly blog posts and whitepapers that highlight our expertise. We’re also considering targeted advertising on platforms where our potential clients are active, such as LinkedIn and crypto-specific forums.

**[00:07:30] Chen:** Additionally, we’re planning to attend and speak at industry conferences and events. This will give us a platform to showcase our technology and engage directly with potential clients.

**[00:07:55] Bob:** Those are solid strategies. Let’s dive deeper into your technical challenges. Chen, what specific areas do you need mentorship in?

**[00:08:00] Chen:** I think we could benefit from mentorship in advanced smart contract security techniques and staying ahead of emerging threats. Additionally, guidance on optimizing our transaction graph analysis algorithms would be valuable.

**[00:08:30] Bob:** And Marcus, what about on the business and compliance side?

**[00:08:35] Marcus:** We could use mentorship in refining our risk frameworks to better align with global regulatory standards. Also, insights into effective go-to-market strategies and scaling our operations would be beneficial.

**[00:09:00] Bob:** Got it. Let’s talk about your team. How many people do you have, and what are their roles?

**[00:09:05] Marcus:** We currently have a team of 10. Besides Chen and me, we have four smart contract engineers, two data analysts, a compliance specialist, and a marketing coordinator.

**[00:09:30] Chen:** Our engineers focus on developing and maintaining our auditing algorithms, while the data analysts handle transaction graph analysis and reporting. The compliance specialist ensures we meet all regulatory requirements, and the marketing coordinator manages our outreach efforts.

**[00:09:55] Bob:** That’s a well-rounded team. How do you ensure everyone is aligned with the company’s goals?

**[00:10:00] Marcus:** We have regular team meetings to discuss our progress and challenges. We also set clear, measurable goals and track our performance against these objectives. Transparent communication and a shared vision are key to keeping everyone aligned.

**[00:10:30] Chen:** Additionally, we encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement. We provide training and development opportunities to keep our team up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends.
