[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Jenna and Sean, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Jenna: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

[00:00:03] Sean: Yeah, thanks for having us.

[00:00:05] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Jenna, tell me your background and role at LocalTreats.

[00:00:10] Jenna: Sure thing. I’m Jenna Bryant, co-founder and CEO of LocalTreats. I have a background as a pastry chef and have worked in the food industry for over a decade. I've always been passionate about connecting local businesses with customers, which led me to start LocalTreats.

[00:00:25] Bob: That’s impressive. Sean, what about you?

[00:00:28] Sean: I’m Sean O’Malley, co-founder and CTO. I have a background in frontend development, specializing in UI/UX design, geolocation APIs, and notification systems. I handle the technical side of LocalTreats, making sure our app is user-friendly and efficient.

[00:00:45] Bob: Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you to launch LocalTreats?

[00:00:49] Jenna: Absolutely. During my time as a pastry chef, I noticed how many small bakeries and artisans struggled to reach a wider audience. They often had leftover inventory that went to waste. I thought, why not create a platform where these businesses can post their daily inventory and flash deals? It’s a win-win for both the shops and the customers.

[00:01:10] Bob: And LocalTreats’ mission in a nutshell?

[00:01:13] Sean: Our mission is to connect local bakeries and artisans with customers in real-time, helping them reduce waste and increase sales through daily inventory updates and flash deals.

[00:01:25] Bob: How did you build your initial prototype?

[00:01:28] Sean: We started by identifying the key features we wanted: a user-friendly interface, geolocation to find nearby bakeries, and a notification system for flash deals. Jenna focused on building partnerships with local businesses, while I developed the app using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.

[00:01:45] Bob: That sounds like a solid foundation. What challenges did you face during the development phase?

[00:01:50] Jenna: One of the biggest challenges was convincing shops to adopt the platform. Many small businesses are hesitant to try new technology, especially if they’re not tech-savvy. We had to show them the benefits and how easy it is to use.

[00:02:05] Sean: On the technical side, integrating geolocation APIs and ensuring the notification system worked seamlessly was a challenge. We also had to make sure the app was scalable and could handle an increasing number of users and listings.

[00:02:20] Bob: Those are common hurdles. How did you overcome them?

[00:02:23] Jenna: We held several workshops and demo sessions with local bakeries to show them how the app works. Seeing it in action made a big difference. We also offered initial support to help them get started.

[00:02:35] Sean: For the technical challenges, we did a lot of testing and iterating. We also reached out to other developers for advice and used open-source resources to improve our integrations.

[00:02:45] Bob: That’s great to hear. Let’s talk about your current struggles. Jenna, you mentioned convincing shops to adopt the platform is still a challenge. Can you elaborate on that?

[00:02:55] Jenna: Sure. While we’ve made progress, there’s still a significant number of shops that are reluctant to use the platform. Some are concerned about the learning curve, others about the cost. We need to find more effective ways to communicate the value and ease of use.

[00:03:10] Bob: What strategies have you tried so far to address this?

[00:03:13] Jenna: We’ve offered free trials, created tutorial videos, and even provided one-on-one training sessions. While these have helped, we’re looking for more scalable solutions.

[00:03:25] Bob: Sean, you mentioned limited understanding of restaurant tech integrations. Can you tell me more about that?

[00:03:30] Sean: Yes, one of the features we want to add is integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems. This would allow bakeries to automatically update their inventory on our platform. However, we’re not familiar with the various POS systems out there and how to integrate with them.

[00:03:45] Bob: That’s a critical feature. Have you done any research on POS integrations?

[00:03:48] Sean: We’ve looked into some popular POS systems and their APIs, but it’s a complex landscape. We need someone with experience in this area to guide us.

[00:03:55] Bob: Understood. Let’s talk about your goals for the next six months. What are your top priorities?

[00:04:00] Jenna: Our top priority is to increase the number of bakeries and artisans on the platform. We also want to improve user engagement by adding more interactive features and personalized recommendations.

[00:04:15] Sean: On the technical side, we want to implement the POS integrations and optimize the app for better performance and scalability.

[00:04:25] Bob: Those are ambitious but achievable goals. How do you plan to measure your success?

[00:04:30] Jenna: We’ll track the number of new businesses joining the platform, user engagement metrics like daily active users, and the number of transactions facilitated through the app.

[00:04:40] Sean: For the technical side, we’ll monitor app performance, user feedback on new features, and the success rate of POS integrations.

[00:04:50] Bob: That’s a comprehensive approach. Let’s discuss your team. How many people are currently working on LocalTreats?

[00:04:55] Jenna: Right now, it’s just the two of us full-time. We have a part-time marketing intern and occasionally hire freelancers for specific tasks like graphic design.

[00:05:05] Bob: Do you have plans to expand the team?

[00:05:08] Sean: Yes, we’re looking to hire a full-time marketing specialist and a backend developer with experience in POS integrations.

[00:05:15] Bob: That makes sense given your goals. How do you handle decision-making within the team?

[00:05:20] Jenna: We have a very collaborative approach. Sean and I discuss major decisions together, considering all angles. For day-to-day decisions, we trust each other’s expertise in our respective areas.

[00:05:30] Bob: That’s a healthy dynamic. Let’s talk about your competition. Who are your main competitors and how do you differentiate yourself?

[00:05:35] Sean: Our main competitors are other food discovery apps and platforms that connect customers with local businesses. What sets us apart is our focus on daily inventory updates and flash deals, which create a sense of urgency and exclusivity.

[00:05:50] Jenna: We also prioritize building strong relationships with local bakeries and artisans, ensuring they feel supported and valued.
