[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Nathaniel and Elizabeth, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Nathaniel: Hi Bob, thanks for having us.

[00:00:04] Elizabeth: Yes, we’re excited to be here.

[00:00:06] Bob: Great! Let’s start with a brief introduction. Nathaniel, tell me your background and role at QuantumFlux Computing.

[00:00:11] Nathaniel: Sure. I’m Nathaniel Brooks, co-founder and CTO of QuantumFlux Computing. I have a PhD in Quantum Information from MIT. My research focused on developing efficient quantum algorithms and compilers for near-term quantum processors. Before starting QuantumFlux, I spent a few years in academia, publishing several papers on quantum computing theory and applications.

[00:00:35] Bob: Impressive background. Elizabeth, what about you?

[00:00:38] Elizabeth: I’m Elizabeth Crane, co-founder and CEO. I have an MBA from Stanford. My expertise lies in strategic partnerships, fundraising, and early-stage operations. I’ve worked with several startups in the past, helping them scale from early-stage to Series A and beyond. At QuantumFlux, I handle the business side of things, ensuring we have the resources and partnerships to bring our technology to market.

[00:01:05] Bob: Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you both to launch QuantumFlux Computing?

[00:01:09] Nathaniel: Absolutely. During my time at MIT, I saw a significant gap between the theoretical advancements in quantum computing and their practical applications. Most quantum algorithms were too complex for current hardware, and there was a lack of efficient compilers to bridge this gap. I wanted to develop tools that could make quantum computing more accessible and practical for enterprise R&D labs.

[00:01:35] Elizabeth: From a business perspective, I saw the potential in quantum computing to revolutionize various industries, from pharmaceuticals to finance. However, the market lacked solutions that could be readily integrated into existing workflows. We saw an opportunity to provide high-efficiency compilers that could make quantum computing more feasible for real-world applications.

[00:02:00] Bob: And QuantumFlux Computing’s mission in a nutshell?

[00:02:03] Elizabeth: Our mission is to develop high-efficiency compilers for near-term quantum processors, enabling enterprise R&D labs to leverage the power of quantum computing for complex simulations and optimizations. We aim to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial applications, making quantum computing more accessible and practical.

[00:02:25] Bob: How did you build your initial prototype?

[00:02:28] Nathaniel: We started by identifying the key challenges in current quantum compilers. We then developed a proprietary algorithm that optimizes quantum circuits for specific hardware constraints. The initial prototype was built using open-source quantum computing frameworks like Qiskit and Cirq. We tested it on various quantum processors available through cloud services, refining our algorithms based on the performance data we gathered.

[00:03:00] Bob: That sounds like a complex process. What were some of the biggest challenges you faced during this phase?

[00:03:04] Nathaniel: One of the biggest challenges was ensuring our compiler could adapt to the diverse architectures of different quantum processors. Each processor has its unique set of qubits, connectivity, and error rates. Designing a compiler that could optimize for these variations was a significant hurdle. Additionally, translating our academic research into a scalable, commercial product required a lot of iterative testing and feedback.

[00:03:35] Bob: Elizabeth, from a business standpoint, what have been some of the key challenges?

[00:03:38] Elizabeth: One of the main challenges has been educating potential customers about the benefits of quantum computing. Many enterprises are still skeptical about the practical applications of quantum technology. Building trust and demonstrating the value proposition of our compilers has been crucial. Additionally, securing funding for a deep tech startup like ours has been challenging, as investors often look for more immediate returns.

[00:04:10] Bob: That’s a common issue for deep tech startups. How have you been addressing these challenges?

[00:04:13] Elizabeth: We’ve been focusing on building strong partnerships with key players in the industry. By collaborating with established companies and research institutions, we can validate our technology and gain credibility. We’ve also been participating in various accelerator programs and competitions to increase our visibility and attract potential investors.

[00:04:40] Bob: That’s a solid strategy. Nathaniel, can you walk me through a typical day in the life of QuantumFlux Computing?

[00:04:44] Nathaniel: Sure. A typical day involves a lot of coding and testing. We start with a morning stand-up where we discuss our progress and any issues we’re facing. I usually spend the first half of the day working on algorithm development and optimization. This involves writing and testing new code, as well as analyzing performance data from our quantum processors. In the afternoon, I often have meetings with our engineering team to discuss new features or improvements to our compiler. We also have regular check-ins with our advisors and partners to get feedback and guidance.

[00:05:25] Bob: That sounds like a packed schedule. Elizabeth, what does your typical day look like?

[00:05:28] Elizabeth: My days are equally busy but focused more on the business side. I start with reviewing our financials and operational metrics. I spend a lot of time on calls with potential partners and investors, discussing collaborations and funding opportunities. I also work closely with our marketing and sales teams to develop strategies for customer acquisition and retention. In the afternoons, I often have meetings with our legal and compliance teams to ensure we’re adhering to all regulations and standards.

[00:06:00] Bob: It’s clear you both have a lot on your plates. Let’s talk about your current struggles. Nathaniel, what are some of the technical challenges you’re facing right now?

[00:06:05] Nathaniel: One of our biggest challenges is scaling our compiler to handle larger and more complex quantum circuits. As quantum processors become more powerful, the circuits they can run also become more complex. Ensuring our compiler can efficiently optimize these circuits without introducing errors is a significant challenge. Additionally, we’re working on integrating our compiler with more quantum hardware providers, which requires adapting our algorithms to different hardware specifications.

[00:06:40] Bob: Those are indeed complex issues. Elizabeth, what about the business challenges?

[00:06:43] Elizabeth: Our main challenge is translating our academic technology into viable commercial use-cases. Quantum computing is still a niche market, and finding the right applications that can demonstrate immediate value to enterprises is difficult. We need mentorship on our go-to-market strategy, particularly for deep tech applications. Additionally, navigating the regulatory landscape for quantum technologies can be challenging, as the field is still evolving.

[00:07:15] Bob: It sounds like you could benefit from some expert guidance. What kind of mentorship are you looking for specifically?

[00:07:18] Elizabeth: We’re looking for mentors with experience in deep tech commercialization, particularly in the quantum computing space. Someone who has successfully brought complex technologies to market and can guide us through the process. Additionally, we need help with our go-to-market strategy, including customer segmentation, value proposition development, and sales strategies.

[00:07:45] Bob: That makes sense. Nathaniel, on the technical side, what kind of expertise would be most beneficial for you?
