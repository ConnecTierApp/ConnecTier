[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Fatima and Luis, thanks for joining this call today.

[00:00:02] Fatima: Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

[00:00:04] Luis: Yes, thanks for having us, Bob.

[00:00:06] Bob: Let’s start with a brief introduction. Fatima, tell me your background and role at SaharSat.

[00:00:11] Fatima: Sure. I’m Fatima Al-Karim, co-founder and CEO of SaharSat. I have a background in aerospace systems engineering, with a focus on satellite design and orbital mechanics. I graduated from the German Jordanian University and have worked on several satellite projects in the Middle East before starting SaharSat.

[00:00:30] Bob: That’s impressive. Luis, could you share your background and role as well?

[00:00:33] Luis: Of course. I’m Luis García Méndez, co-founder and CTO of SaharSat. I specialize in satellite communications, particularly ground station communications, spectrum allocation, and telemetry systems. I studied at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and have experience working with various space agencies in Latin America.

[00:00:55] Bob: Fantastic. Can you both share what inspired you to launch SaharSat?

[00:01:00] Fatima: Absolutely. During my work in the aerospace industry, I noticed a significant gap in access to Earth observation data, especially in developing countries. These regions often lack the infrastructure and resources to gather and analyze such data, which is crucial for agriculture and disaster response. Luis and I saw an opportunity to bridge this gap by providing a low-cost CubeSat platform.

[00:01:25] Luis: Exactly. We wanted to democratize access to Earth observation data. By leveraging CubeSat technology, we can provide affordable and accessible solutions that can greatly benefit these regions.

[00:01:40] Bob: And SaharSat’s mission in a nutshell?

[00:01:43] Fatima: Our mission is to launch a low-cost CubeSat platform that provides developing countries with access to Earth observation data. This data can be used for various applications, including agriculture monitoring, disaster response, and environmental conservation.

[00:02:00] Bob: How did you build your initial prototype?

[00:02:03] Luis: We started by securing partnerships with universities and research institutions that had experience in CubeSat development. We leveraged their facilities and expertise to design and build our first prototype. Fatima focused on the satellite design and orbital mechanics, while I handled the ground station communications and telemetry systems.

[00:02:25] Fatima: Yes, it was a collaborative effort. We also received some initial funding from grants and competitions, which helped us cover the costs of materials and testing.

[00:02:40] Bob: That’s great to hear. What are the current challenges you’re facing?

[00:02:43] Fatima: One of our biggest challenges is navigating the complexities of international licensing and regulations. Launching a satellite involves compliance with various international treaties and national regulations, which can be quite daunting.

[00:03:00] Luis: Additionally, we’re struggling to secure investment from global space tech funds. While we’ve had some success with grants and competitions, we need more substantial funding to scale our operations and launch more satellites.

[00:03:15] Bob: Those are indeed significant challenges. Let’s dive deeper into the international licensing aspect. What specific areas are you finding most challenging?

[00:03:20] Fatima: The main challenge is understanding and complying with the regulations of different countries. Each country has its own set of rules and requirements for satellite launches and operations. We need guidance on how to navigate these regulations and ensure that our platform is compliant.

[00:03:40] Bob: And in terms of securing investment, what strategies have you tried so far?

[00:03:43] Luis: We’ve participated in several pitch competitions and applied for grants. We’ve also reached out to various venture capital firms and angel investors, but we’ve found that the space tech sector can be quite competitive and challenging to break into.

[00:04:00] Bob: Have you considered public-private partnerships as a potential funding source?

[00:04:03] Fatima: We’ve explored the idea, but we’re not sure how to go about forming such partnerships. We need mentorship on how to identify potential partners, approach them, and structure these partnerships effectively.

[00:04:20] Bob: That makes sense. Let’s talk about your team. How many people are currently working at SaharSat, and what are their roles?

[00:04:23] Luis: We have a core team of eight people. Apart from Fatima and me, we have two satellite engineers, two software developers, one data analyst, and one business development manager.

[00:04:40] Bob: That’s a well-rounded team. How do you ensure that everyone is aligned with the company’s goals and vision?

[00:05:00] Bob: Communication is key. How do you handle project management and timelines?

[00:05:03] Luis: We use project management tools like Trello and Asana to track our tasks and milestones. We set clear deadlines and regularly review our progress to ensure we’re on track. Fatima’s background in aerospace project management has been invaluable in this regard.

[00:05:20] Bob: That’s great to hear. Let’s talk about your target market. Who are your primary customers, and how do you plan to reach them?

[00:05:23] Fatima: Our primary customers are governments and organizations in developing countries that need access to Earth observation data. We plan to reach them through targeted marketing campaigns, partnerships with local organizations, and participation in international conferences and events.

[00:05:40] Bob: Have you identified any key partnerships or collaborations that could help you reach your target market?

[00:05:43] Luis: We’re in talks with a few international organizations and NGOs that work in the areas of agriculture and disaster response. These partnerships could help us gain credibility and access to our target market.

[00:06:00] Bob: That sounds promising. Let’s discuss your technology in more detail. What makes your CubeSat platform unique compared to other solutions in the market?

[00:06:03] Fatima: Our platform is unique in several ways. First, we use advanced imaging sensors that provide high-resolution data. Second, our ground station communications system is designed to be highly efficient, ensuring reliable data transmission. Finally, our data processing algorithms are optimized for quick and accurate analysis.

[00:06:25] Bob: That’s impressive. How do you ensure the quality and reliability of your data?

[00:06:28] Luis: We have a rigorous testing and validation process. We conduct extensive ground testing of our sensors and communications systems before launch. Once in orbit, we continuously monitor the performance of our satellites and conduct regular calibrations to ensure data accuracy.

[00:06:45] Bob: That’s crucial for maintaining trust with your customers. How do you plan to scale your operations as you grow?

[00:06:48] Fatima: We plan to scale by launching more satellites to increase our coverage and data collection capabilities. We also plan to expand our team, particularly in the areas of data analysis and business development. Additionally, we’re exploring partnerships with other space tech companies to leverage their infrastructure and expertise.
