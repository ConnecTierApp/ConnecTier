**[00:00:00] Bob:** Hello Amina and Darnell, thanks for joining this call today.

**[00:00:02] Amina:** Hi Bob, great to chat with you.

**[00:00:03] Darnell:** Yeah, thanks for having us, Bob.

**[00:00:05] Bob:** Let’s start with a brief introduction. Amina, tell me your background and role at Kinyei Media.

**[00:00:10] Amina:** Sure thing. I'm Amina Otieno, one of the co-founders of Kinyei Media. I have a background in film and TV production, with a focus on storytelling and cultural curation. I've worked on several projects across Kenya and the broader African continent, aiming to bring authentic African stories to the global stage. At Kinyei Media, I oversee content creation and partnerships with creators.

**[00:00:35] Bob:** That’s impressive. Darnell, what about you?

I've spent years working on audio engineering projects and preserving archival materials. My expertise lies in P2P streaming protocols, which is crucial for our decentralized media distribution network. I handle the technical side of things at Kinyei Media.

**[00:01:05] Bob:** Fantastic. Can you share what inspired you both to launch Kinyei Media?

**[00:01:09] Amina:** Absolutely. Darnell and I met at a media conference in Nairobi a few years back. We both noticed a significant gap in the distribution of African content. Many creators struggle to get their work seen due to censorship and lack of infrastructure. We wanted to create a platform that bypasses these barriers and allows African and diaspora creators to share their stories freely.

**[00:01:35] Darnell:** Yeah, and from a technical standpoint, I saw the potential in decentralized technologies to create a more resilient and censorship-resistant distribution network. We believe that by combining our strengths in content creation and technology, we can make a real impact.

**[00:01:55] Bob:** And Kinyei Media’s mission in a nutshell?

**[00:02:00] Amina:** Our mission is to empower African and diaspora creators by providing a decentralized media distribution network. This network allows them to bypass censorship and stream independent content directly to their audiences, fostering a more diverse and inclusive media landscape.

**[00:02:15] Bob:** How did you build your initial prototype?

**[00:02:17] Darnell:** We started by researching existing P2P streaming protocols and decentralized technologies. I spent a lot of time experimenting with different protocols and eventually settled on a combination that worked best for our needs. Amina, on the other hand, focused on building a network of creators who were eager to test our platform.

**[00:02:40] Amina:** Yes, we reached out to several independent filmmakers and content creators in Kenya and other African countries. Their feedback was invaluable in shaping the initial prototype. We wanted to ensure that the platform was user-friendly and met their specific needs.

**[00:03:00] Bob:** That’s a great approach. What were some of the initial challenges you faced?

**[00:03:05] Darnell:** One of the biggest challenges was integrating the P2P streaming protocols with our content management system. Ensuring that the content was securely distributed and easily accessible to users was a complex task. We also had to deal with varying internet speeds and reliability across different regions.

**[00:03:30] Amina:** On the content side, convincing creators to trust a new platform was a hurdle. Many were skeptical about the security and reach of our network. It took a lot of effort to build that trust and demonstrate the value of our platform.

**[00:03:50] Bob:** How did you overcome these challenges?

**[00:03:52] Darnell:** We implemented robust encryption and data integrity checks to ensure the security of the content. For the technical issues, we conducted extensive testing in different environments to optimize the streaming protocols. We also worked on creating a user-friendly interface that made it easy for creators to upload and manage their content.

**[00:04:20] Amina:** On the trust side, we organized several workshops and webinars to educate creators about the benefits of decentralized distribution. We also showcased success stories from our early adopters, which helped build credibility.

**[00:04:40] Bob:** That’s impressive. Let’s talk about your current struggles. What are the biggest challenges you’re facing right now?

**[00:04:45] Amina:** One of our major struggles is navigating international copyright issues. As we expand, we need to ensure that our platform complies with copyright laws in different countries. This is a complex area, and we lack the expertise to handle it effectively.

**[00:05:10] Darnell:** On the technical side, scaling our distributed systems is a significant challenge. As more creators and users join the platform, we need to ensure that our infrastructure can handle the increased load without compromising performance.

**[00:05:30] Bob:** Those are indeed critical areas. How do you think mentors could help you address these challenges?

**[00:05:35] Amina:** We would greatly benefit from mentors with expertise in international copyright law. They could guide us through the legal landscape and help us develop strategies to protect our creators' content while complying with regulations.

**[00:06:20] Amina:** We need help understanding the nuances of copyright protection in different regions, especially in Africa and the diaspora. This includes licensing agreements, fair use policies, and how to handle disputes. We also need guidance on setting up a legal framework that protects both the creators and the platform.
