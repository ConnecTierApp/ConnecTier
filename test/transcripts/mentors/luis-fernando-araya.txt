[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Luis, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m excited to learn about your unique background and how you can mentor our startups.

[00:00:08] Luis: Thank you, Bob. I’m Luis Fernando Araya, former astronaut candidate and aerospace engineer, now focusing on STEM outreach in rural Latin America.

[00:00:18] Bob: That’s quite a journey! Can you share more about your experience as an astronaut candidate and aerospace engineer?

[00:00:22] Luis: Certainly. I was part of the Chilean astronaut program, which was a rigorous selection process involving physical, psychological, and technical evaluations. As an aerospace engineer, I worked on satellite design and orbital mechanics, contributing to several space missions.

[00:00:45] Bob: Fascinating. What were some of the key challenges you faced in these roles?

[00:00:48] Luis: One of the biggest challenges was managing multicultural teams. Space missions often involve collaboration with international partners, each with their own work cultures and communication styles. Ensuring everyone was on the same page and working towards a common goal was crucial.

[00:01:10] Bob: How did you overcome these challenges?

[00:01:13] Luis: I focused on clear communication and fostering a culture of mutual respect. We had regular check-ins, used translation tools when necessary, and encouraged open dialogue. This helped in building a cohesive team despite the cultural differences.

[00:01:35] Bob: That’s insightful. How did you transition from aerospace engineering to public education and STEM outreach?

[00:01:38] Luis: After my time as an astronaut candidate, I realized the importance of inspiring the next generation. I saw a gap in STEM education, especially in rural areas of Latin America. I believed that by bringing space science and technology to these regions, we could ignite a passion for STEM and create more opportunities for young people.

[00:02:05] Bob: What strategies have you employed to make STEM education more accessible and engaging?

[00:02:08] Luis: We’ve developed interactive workshops and hands-on projects that connect space science to everyday life. For example, we use simple experiments to explain orbital mechanics or build small models to demonstrate satellite communication. We also leverage local resources and collaborate with schools and community centers to reach a wider audience.

[00:02:35] Bob: How do you measure the impact of your STEM outreach programs?

[00:02:38] Luis: We track several metrics, including the number of participants, their engagement levels, and the retention rate of students in STEM subjects. We also conduct surveys to gather feedback from students and teachers. The qualitative data helps us understand the long-term impact on their interest and career choices in STEM fields.

[00:03:05] Bob: That’s a comprehensive approach. How do you think your experience can benefit the startups in our accelerator?

[00:03:08] Luis: I believe my background in managing complex projects and multicultural teams can be valuable. Startups often face challenges in scaling their operations and managing diverse teams. I can help them develop strategies for effective communication, project management, and team cohesion.

[00:03:35] Bob: Absolutely. Can you give an example of a project where you had to connect a big vision to grounded execution?

[00:03:38] Luis: Sure. One of our STEM outreach programs aimed to build a small satellite with students from rural schools. The vision was to inspire them by showing that they could contribute to space exploration. To execute this, we broke down the project into manageable tasks, such as designing the satellite structure, programming the onboard computer, and testing communication systems. We involved the students in each step, ensuring they understood the practical applications of what they were learning.

[00:04:15] Bob: How did you ensure the students stayed motivated and engaged throughout the project?

[00:04:18] Luis: We created a supportive learning environment where students could ask questions and experiment without fear of failure. We also celebrated small victories along the way, which kept the momentum going. Seeing their work come to life, even in small increments, was a powerful motivator.

[00:04:45] Bob: That’s a great approach. How do you handle setbacks or failures in your projects?

[00:04:48] Luis: Setbacks are inevitable, especially in ambitious projects. The key is to view them as learning opportunities. We analyze what went wrong, discuss it openly with the team, and brainstorm solutions. This iterative process helps us improve and move forward.

[00:05:15] Bob: How do you stay updated with the latest developments in space systems and orbital mechanics?
