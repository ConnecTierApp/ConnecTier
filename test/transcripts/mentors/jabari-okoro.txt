**[00:00:00] Bob:** Hello Jabari, thanks for speaking with me today. I’d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

**[00:00:05] Jabari:** Hi Bob, thanks for having me. I’m Jabari Okoro, currently the Business Development Lead at a pan-African infrastructure firm. Before this, I was a strategy consultant at McKinsey Africa.

**[00:00:15] Bob:** Great. Can you share more about your experience at McKinsey Africa?

**[00:00:18] Jabari:** Absolutely. I joined McKinsey Africa in 2015 and worked on a variety of projects, primarily focused on public-private partnerships and infrastructure financing. One of the key projects I led was the development of a strategic plan for a major infrastructure project in Nigeria. We had to navigate complex regulatory environments, secure financing from both private and public sectors, and ensure the project had a positive impact on the local economy.

**[00:00:45] Bob:** That sounds challenging. What were some of the biggest hurdles you faced in that project?

**[00:00:48] Jabari:** One of the biggest challenges was aligning the interests of multiple stakeholders—government agencies, private investors, and local communities. Each had different priorities and expectations. We had to conduct extensive stakeholder engagement, build trust, and create a shared vision for the project. Another significant challenge was securing sustainable financing. We had to explore innovative financing models, including blended finance and impact investing, to attract both domestic and international capital.

**[00:01:20] Bob:** How did you manage to align these diverse interests?

**[00:01:23] Jabari:** It was a combination of continuous communication, transparency, and finding common ground. We organized workshops and roundtable discussions to understand each stakeholder's concerns and expectations. We also developed a robust impact assessment framework to demonstrate the project's economic, social, and environmental benefits. This helped in building consensus and securing buy-in from all parties involved.

**[00:01:50] Bob:** That’s impressive. Can you talk about your current role as Business Development Lead at a pan-African infrastructure firm?

**[00:01:53] Jabari:** Sure. In my current role, I’m responsible for identifying and pursuing new business opportunities across Africa. This involves market analysis, building strategic partnerships, and developing expansion strategies. One of our recent successes was entering the East African market by forming a joint venture with a local construction firm. This allowed us to leverage local expertise and networks while bringing in our own technical and financial capabilities.

**[00:02:25] Bob:** What strategies do you employ for market analysis and expansion?

**[00:02:28] Jabari:** We use a combination of macroeconomic analysis, market research, and on-the-ground intelligence. For example, when we were looking to expand into East Africa, we conducted a comprehensive study of the region's infrastructure needs, regulatory environment, and competitive landscape. We also engaged with local tech hubs and accelerators to understand the startup ecosystem and identify potential partners. This holistic approach helped us make informed decisions and tailor our strategies to the specific market conditions.

**[00:03:00] Bob:** How do you leverage your networks with government agencies and multilaterals?

**[00:03:03] Jabari:** My networks with government agencies and multilaterals like the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank have been invaluable. These relationships help us access critical information, secure funding, and navigate regulatory challenges. For instance, when we were working on a public-private partnership for a renewable energy project in Kenya, our close ties with the AfDB helped us secure a significant portion of the financing and expedite the approval process.

**[00:03:35] Bob:** That’s a great example of how networks can facilitate projects. How do you approach mentoring startups, especially those in frontier markets?

**[00:03:38] Jabari:** When mentoring startups, I focus on three key areas: strategic planning, stakeholder management, and impact assessment. I help startups develop robust expansion strategies that consider the unique challenges and opportunities of frontier markets. This includes understanding local regulations, building strong relationships with government agencies, and securing sustainable financing. I also emphasize the importance of stakeholder management, ensuring that startups engage effectively with local communities, partners, and investors.

**[00:04:15] Bob:** Can you give an example of a startup you’ve mentored and the outcomes achieved?

**[00:04:18] Jabari:** Sure. I recently mentored a startup in the agri-tech space that was looking to scale its operations in West Africa. They had a innovative solution for improving crop yields but struggled with market penetration and financing. I worked with them to develop a comprehensive market entry strategy, which included identifying key partners, securing pilot projects with local farmers, and attracting impact investors. Within a year, they successfully launched in two new markets, increased their user base by 50%, and secured $1 million in funding.

**[00:04:55] Bob:** That’s a significant achievement. How did you help them secure the funding?

**[00:04:58] Jabari:** We started by refining their business model and financial projections to make a compelling case for investors. I also leveraged my networks to introduce them to potential impact investors and multilaterals. We prepared a robust investment pitch that highlighted the startup's social and environmental impact, as well as its financial potential. This approach resonated well with impact investors, leading to successful funding rounds.

**[00:05:30] Bob:** What advice do you give startups on navigating regulatory challenges in African markets?

**[00:05:33] Jabari:** Navigating regulatory challenges requires a proactive and collaborative approach. I advise startups to engage early and often with regulatory bodies, understand the local legal framework, and comply with all necessary requirements. Building relationships with government agencies and seeking their guidance can also help in navigating complex regulations. Additionally, partnering with local experts or consultants who have a deep understanding of the regulatory environment can be very beneficial.

**[00:06:05] Bob:** That’s sound advice. How do you stay updated with the latest trends and developments in infrastructure and public-private partnerships?

**[00:06:08] Jabari:** Staying updated is crucial in this fast-changing landscape. I regularly attend industry conferences, participate in webinars, and read research reports from think tanks and multilaterals. I also maintain active engagement with my professional networks, including alumni from McKinsey and colleagues from my current firm. These interactions provide valuable insights and keep me informed about emerging trends and best practices.

**[00:06:40] Bob:** What role do you see technology playing in infrastructure development in Africa?

**[00:06:43] Jabari:** Technology is a game-changer in infrastructure development. It enables more efficient and sustainable solutions. For example, the use of IoT and data analytics can optimize resource management, reduce costs, and improve service delivery. Renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind, are also becoming more cost-effective and accessible, driving the transition to cleaner energy sources. Additionally, digital platforms can enhance stakeholder engagement, transparency, and accountability in infrastructure projects.

**[00:07:20] Bob:** How do you incorporate technology into your mentoring approach?

**[00:07:23] Jabari:** I encourage startups to leverage technology to enhance their operations and scale more effectively. This could mean adopting digital tools for data collection and analysis, using mobile apps for customer engagement, or integrating IoT solutions for real-time monitoring. I also help startups identify and partner with tech providers who can offer innovative solutions tailored to their needs. For example, I recently connected an agri-tech startup with a tech firm specializing in drone technology for precision agriculture, which significantly improved their crop monitoring capabilities.

**[00:08:00] Bob:** That’s a great example of how technology can drive innovation. What are some common mistakes you see startups making in frontier markets?

**[00:08:03] Jabari:** One of the most common mistakes is underestimating the complexity of the local market. Startups often assume that what works in one market will work in another, without fully understanding the local context. This includes cultural nuances, regulatory environments, and consumer behaviors. Another mistake is not building strong local partnerships. Local partners can provide invaluable insights, networks, and credibility, which are crucial for success in frontier markets.

**[00:08:40] Bob:** How do you help startups avoid these mistakes?

**[00:08:43] Jabari:** I emphasize the importance of thorough market research and local engagement. I encourage startups to conduct pilot projects to test their assumptions and gather feedback from local stakeholders. Building a diverse team with local expertise can also help in navigating the complexities of the market. Additionally, I advise startups to be flexible and adaptable, ready to pivot their strategies based on market feedback and changing conditions.

**[00:09:20] Bob:** What role do you see impact assessment playing in startup success?

**[00:09:23] Jabari:** Impact assessment is critical for startups, especially those operating in frontier markets. It helps in demonstrating the social, environmental, and economic benefits of their solutions, which can attract impact investors and secure government support. A robust impact assessment framework can also guide startups in making informed decisions, ensuring that their operations align with sustainable development goals. I work with startups to develop impact assessment frameworks that measure key performance indicators and track progress over time.

**[00:10:00] Bob:** How do you measure the success of the startups you mentor?

**[00:10:03] Jabari:** Success can be measured in various ways, depending on the startup's goals and stage of development. Key metrics include financial performance, market penetration, customer satisfaction, and impact on local communities. I also look at the startup's ability to secure funding, build strategic partnerships, and scale sustainably. Ultimately, the success of a startup is a combination of financial sustainability, social impact, and long-term growth potential.

**[00:10:40] Bob:** What challenges do you face as a mentor, and how do you overcome them?

**[00:10:43] Jabari:** One of the biggest challenges is balancing the need to provide guidance while allowing startups to make their own decisions. It's important to empower startups to take ownership of their journey while offering support and expertise. Another challenge is staying updated with the rapidly evolving startup ecosystem and technological advancements. I overcome these challenges by maintaining open communication with startups, continuously learning from their experiences, and staying engaged with industry trends and developments.

**[00:11:20] Bob:** How do you ensure that the startups you mentor are prepared for long-term success?

**[00:11:23] Jabari:** Preparing startups for long-term success involves building a strong foundation of strategic planning, operational excellence, and financial sustainability. I work with startups to develop comprehensive business plans, secure sustainable financing, and build robust operational processes. I also emphasize the importance of continuous learning and adaptation, encouraging startups to stay updated with industry trends and innovations. Building a strong team with diverse skills and expertise is also crucial for long-term success.

**[00:12:00] Bob:** What advice would you give to aspiring mentors in the startup ecosystem?

**[00:12:03] Jabari:** Aspiring mentors should focus on building a deep understanding of the startup ecosystem, staying updated with industry trends, and developing strong networks.

**[00:12:40] Bob:** How do you see the startup ecosystem in Africa evolving in the next five years?

**[00:12:43] Jabari:** The startup ecosystem in Africa is poised for significant growth and innovation. We can expect to see more startups leveraging technology to address critical challenges in sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and renewable energy. There will be increased investment from both local and international investors, driven by the growing recognition of Africa's potential as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. Governments and multilaterals will also play a crucial role in supporting the ecosystem through policies, funding, and infrastructure development.

**[00:13:20] Bob:** What role do you see mentors playing in this evolution?

**[00:13:23] Jabari:** Mentors will play a vital role in guiding startups through the complexities of scaling and navigating the evolving landscape. They will provide strategic insights, operational expertise, and networks that are essential for startup success. Mentors will also help in fostering a culture of innovation, continuous learning, and collaboration within the ecosystem. By sharing their experiences and knowledge, mentors can inspire and empower the next generation of entrepreneurs to drive Africa's development.

**[00:14:00] Bob:** How do you balance your professional responsibilities with your mentoring activities?

**[00:14:03] Jabari:** Balancing professional responsibilities with mentoring requires effective time management, prioritization, and delegation. I set aside dedicated time for mentoring activities and ensure that I am fully present and engaged during these sessions. I also leverage technology to stay connected with startups and provide support remotely when needed. Building a strong team at work allows me to delegate tasks and focus on high-priority areas, including mentoring.

**[00:14:40] Bob:** What motivates you to continue mentoring startups?

**[00:14:43] Jabari:** My motivation comes from the impact I see in the startups I mentor. Watching them grow, scale, and make a positive difference in their communities is incredibly rewarding. I am also inspired by the innovation and resilience of African entrepreneurs, who are tackling some of the continent's most pressing challenges with creative and sustainable solutions. Mentoring allows me to contribute to this ecosystem and be part of Africa's development journey.

**[00:15:20] Bob:** How do you ensure that your mentoring approach is inclusive and accessible to diverse startups?

**[00:15:23] Jabari:** Inclusivity and accessibility are crucial in mentoring. I strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where all startups feel valued and heard. This involves being sensitive to cultural differences, understanding the unique challenges faced by diverse entrepreneurs, and providing tailored support that meets their specific needs. I also actively seek out and engage with startups from underrepresented groups, ensuring that my mentoring activities are accessible to a wide range of entrepreneurs.

**[00:16:00] Bob:** What role do you see technology playing in making mentoring more accessible?

**[00:16:03] Jabari:** Technology can significantly enhance the accessibility of mentoring. Digital platforms and tools can facilitate remote mentoring, allowing mentors to connect with startups regardless of geographical barriers. Online resources, webinars, and virtual workshops can provide valuable information and support to startups who may not have access to in-person mentoring.
