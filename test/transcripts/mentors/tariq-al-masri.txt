[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Tariq, thanks for speaking with me today. Iâ€™d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

[00:00:05] Tariq: Hi Bob, thanks for having me. I'm Tariq Al-Masri, a cybersecurity expert and former CISO at a multinational bank. Currently, I advise startups in fintech and critical infrastructure.

[00:00:15] Bob: Great. Can you share your experience as the CISO at the multinational bank?

[00:00:18] Tariq: Certainly. I joined the bank in 2015 and was responsible for overseeing the entire cybersecurity framework. We had to manage a complex environment with multiple regulatory requirements and a vast customer base. My role involved everything from cloud security architecture to incident response and risk mitigation.

[00:00:40] Bob: That sounds like a massive responsibility. What were some of the initial challenges you faced?

[00:00:43] Tariq: One of the biggest challenges was ensuring compliance with various regulatory standards like PCI-DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2. We had to implement robust security measures without disrupting the bank's operations. Another challenge was managing the transition to cloud services, specifically AWS and Azure, while maintaining security integrity.

[00:01:10] Bob: How did you approach cloud security architecture in such a sensitive environment?

[00:01:13] Tariq: We started by conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities. We then designed a multi-layered security architecture that included encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring. We also worked closely with cloud providers to ensure that their security measures aligned with our requirements.

[00:01:40] Bob: That's comprehensive. Can you give an example of a specific project you led that had a significant impact?

[00:01:43] Tariq: One project that stands out is the implementation of a new incident response framework. We developed a playbook that outlined clear procedures for detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents. This included setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) and training staff on incident response protocols. The result was a significant reduction in response times and improved overall security posture.

[00:02:15] Bob: Impressive. How do you stay updated with the latest threats and compliance requirements?

[00:02:18] Tariq: I maintain strong ties with CISOs and IT heads in the banking and telecom sectors. Additionally, I'm part of cybersecurity investor and threat intel communities. These networks provide valuable insights and early warnings about emerging threats. I also attend industry conferences and participate in webinars to stay current with the latest trends and regulations.

[00:02:50] Bob: That's a proactive approach. How do you apply your expertise when mentoring startups?

[00:02:53] Tariq: When working with startups, especially those in fintech and critical infrastructure, I focus on building trust with enterprise customers and avoiding compliance pitfalls. I help them understand the importance of security from the ground up, ensuring that it's integrated into their product development lifecycle. This includes guiding them on cloud security architecture, regulatory compliance, and incident response strategies.

[00:03:30] Bob: Can you walk me through a typical mentoring session with a startup?

[00:03:33] Tariq: Sure. I usually start with an assessment of their current security posture. We discuss their business model, target market, and any specific regulatory requirements they need to comply with. Based on this, I provide tailored advice on how to strengthen their security measures. This might include recommendations on encryption standards, access controls, and incident response plans. I also help them prepare for compliance audits and customer security assessments.

[00:04:10] Bob: That's valuable. How do you handle startups that might be resistant to investing in security early on?

[00:04:13] Tariq: It's a common challenge, especially for early-stage startups that are focused on growth and innovation. I emphasize the long-term benefits of investing in security early. I explain how a robust security framework can be a competitive advantage, building trust with customers and investors. I also share real-world examples of startups that faced security breaches and the consequences they had to deal with.

[00:04:45] Bob: That's a persuasive approach. Can you share a success story from your mentoring experience?

[00:04:48] Tariq: Absolutely. I worked with a fintech startup that was struggling with regulatory compliance. They were about to launch a new product but were held back by compliance issues. I helped them navigate the complexities of GDPR and PCI-DSS, ensuring that their product met all the necessary standards. We also implemented a robust incident response framework. As a result, they successfully launched their product and secured several enterprise customers, largely due to their strong security posture.

[00:05:25] Bob: That's a great outcome. How do you see the future of cybersecurity in the startup ecosystem?

[00:05:28] Tariq: I believe cybersecurity will become even more critical as startups continue to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. The increasing reliance on cloud services and the proliferation of IoT devices will present new challenges and opportunities. Startups that prioritize security from the outset will have a significant advantage in the market.

[00:05:55] Bob: That's insightful. How do you think startups can better prepare for future cyber threats?

[00:05:58] Tariq: Startups need to adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity. This includes regular risk assessments, continuous monitoring, and staying updated with the latest threats. They should also invest in training and awareness programs for their employees. Collaboration with industry peers and participation in cybersecurity communities can also provide valuable insights and support.

[00:06:30] Bob: That's sound advice. How do you balance the need for security with the need for innovation and agility in startups?

[00:06:33] Tariq: It's a delicate balance, but it's achievable. Startups need to integrate security into their development processes without hindering innovation. This can be done by adopting DevSecOps practices, where security is considered at every stage of the development lifecycle. Automated security tools and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can also help maintain agility while ensuring security.

[00:07:05] Bob: That's a holistic approach. How do you measure the success of your mentoring efforts?

[00:07:08] Tariq: I measure success based on several factors. Firstly, the startup's ability to comply with regulatory requirements and pass security audits. Secondly, their ability to respond effectively to security incidents. Thirdly, the trust and confidence they build with customers and investors. Ultimately, I want to see the startups I mentor achieve sustainable growth and success in their respective markets.

[00:07:40] Bob: Those are solid metrics. How do you handle feedback from the startups you mentor?

[00:07:43] Tariq: Feedback is crucial for continuous improvement. I encourage startups to provide honest feedback on my mentoring approach and the advice I give. I use this feedback to refine my methods and ensure that I'm providing the most relevant and effective guidance. I also stay in touch with the startups long after the initial mentoring sessions to understand their progress and any challenges they face.

[00:08:15] Bob: That's a dedicated approach. How do you stay motivated and passionate about cybersecurity?

[00:08:18] Tariq: Cybersecurity is a dynamic and ever-evolving field. The constant challenge of staying ahead of threats and finding innovative solutions keeps me motivated. I also find it rewarding to see the startups I mentor achieve success and make a positive impact in their industries. The sense of contributing to a safer digital world is deeply satisfying.

[00:08:50] Bob: That's inspiring. How do you see the role of mentors like yourself in the startup ecosystem?

[00:08:53] Tariq: Mentors play a critical role in guiding startups through the complexities of building a successful business. We provide valuable insights, expertise, and support that startups might not have access to otherwise. By sharing our experiences and knowledge, we help startups avoid common pitfalls and accelerate their growth.
