[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Isabelle, thanks for speaking with me today. Iâ€™d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

[00:00:05] Isabelle: Hi Bob, thanks for having me. I'm Isabelle Cho, a climate finance strategist. I previously worked with the UN Green Climate Fund and now I consult for sustainability-focused startups.

[00:00:15] Bob: That's impressive. Can you share more about your experience at the UN Green Climate Fund?

[00:00:20] Isabelle: Absolutely. I joined the UN Green Climate Fund in 2015. My role involved managing climate finance projects, particularly focusing on carbon markets and climate risk modeling. We worked on various initiatives to mobilize funding for climate-resilient and low-emission development projects across different regions.

[00:00:45] Bob: That sounds like a significant role. What were some of the key projects you worked on?

[00:00:50] Isabelle: One of the key projects was developing a framework for carbon credits trading in developing countries. We also worked on climate risk assessments for vulnerable communities, which involved creating models to predict and mitigate climate-related risks. Another major initiative was aligning investment portfolios with the Paris Agreement goals.

[00:01:20] Bob: How did you ensure the projects were aligned with global sustainability standards?

[00:01:25] Isabelle: We used various ESG frameworks to ensure that the projects met environmental, social, and governance criteria. This involved extensive reporting and compliance with international standards. We also collaborated with climate NGOs and academic think tanks to stay updated with the latest research and best practices.

[00:01:50] Bob: Can you give an example of a successful project you led?

[00:01:55] Isabelle: One of the most successful projects was the implementation of a carbon market in a Southeast Asian country. We worked with local governments and private sectors to establish a robust carbon trading system. This not only helped in reducing carbon emissions but also attracted significant green investments into the region.

[00:02:25] Bob: That's fantastic. How do you apply this experience when mentoring startups?

[00:02:30] Isabelle: When mentoring startups, I focus on helping them align their business models with global sustainability financing and standards.

[00:03:05] Isabelle: One of the biggest challenges is fundraising. Many startups struggle to find climate-aligned capital. Another challenge is navigating the complex landscape of ESG frameworks and ensuring compliance. Additionally, startups often need help in building strong relationships with climate NGOs and academic think tanks to leverage their expertise.

[00:03:35] Bob: How do you help startups overcome these challenges?

[00:03:40] Isabelle: I provide strategic guidance on fundraising from climate-aligned capital.

[00:04:10] Bob: Can you share a success story of a startup you've mentored?

[00:04:15] Isabelle: Sure. I recently worked with a startup that was developing sustainable agriculture solutions. They were struggling to attract investors despite having a innovative product. I helped them restructure their business model to align with ESG criteria and prepared a comprehensive investor report. Within six months, they secured funding from a major green investment fund and scaled their operations significantly.

[00:04:45] Bob: That's a great outcome. What are some key metrics you use to measure the success of the startups you mentor?

[00:04:50] Isabelle: I look at several metrics, including the amount of green investment they attract, their compliance with ESG frameworks, and their impact on carbon emission reduction.
