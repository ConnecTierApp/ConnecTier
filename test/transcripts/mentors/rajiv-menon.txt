[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Rajiv, thanks for speaking with me today. I’d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

[00:00:05] Rajiv: Hi Bob, thanks for having me. I'm Rajiv Menon, former Chief Data Officer at a global logistics firm. Now, I advise startups that are building AI-driven supply chain solutions.

[00:00:15] Bob: That's fantastic. Can you tell me more about your experience as the Chief Data Officer?

[00:00:20] Rajiv: Sure. I joined the firm in 2015 and was responsible for overseeing the data strategy, which included everything from data collection and warehousing to advanced analytics and predictive modeling.
