\[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Evan, thanks for taking the time. I’d like to hear about your background and how you mentor startups.
\[00:00:05] Evan: Thanks Bob, happy to join. I’m Evan Kim, technical co-founder of an AI startup acquired by Adobe in 2022, now advising creator tools companies.
\[00:00:14] Bob: Great. Can you describe your startup and acquisition journey?
\[00:00:18] Evan: Sure. We built an AI-powered video editing assistant, raised a Series A in 2020, grew to 25 engineers, then Adobe acquired us for \$150M to integrate our tech into Premiere Pro.
\[00:00:33] Bob: What were the key technical challenges you faced early on?
\[00:00:37] Evan: Building scalable inference pipelines, optimizing ML models for real-time performance in desktop applications, and managing cross-platform integration.
\[00:00:50] Bob: How did you solve scalability?
\[00:00:52] Evan: We built a hybrid architecture—local model inference with optimized ONNX runtimes and cloud-based batch rendering for heavier tasks, balancing latency and cost.
\[00:01:08] Bob: And cross-platform integration?
\[00:01:11] Evan: We built native plugins for Windows and macOS using C++ SDKs, wrapped them with a common JS-based API layer, then maintained sync between desktop and cloud components.
\[00:01:28] Bob: From a mentorship perspective, what’s your approach?
\[00:01:31] Evan: I focus on product-market fit for creator workflows, optimizing ML ops, and building go-to-market partnerships with platforms like YouTube and TikTok.
\[00:01:47] Bob: Let’s talk product-market fit. How did you validate your initial hypotheses?
\[00:01:50] Evan: We ran closed beta with 50 power users, tracked task completion times, NPS, and iterated features such as auto-captioning, smart cuts, and style transfer until metrics improved.
\[00:02:10] Bob: What metrics did you use?
\[00:02:12] Evan: Time saved per edit, percentage of automated edits accepted without manual tweak, and weekly active usage among our pilot group.
\[00:02:27] Bob: On ML ops, what infrastructure did you use?
\[00:02:30] Evan: We used Kubernetes for model serving, auto-scaling GPU nodes on GCP, model versioning with MLflow, and continuous training pipelines triggered by new labeled data.
\[00:02:50] Bob: Any pitfalls there?
\[00:02:52] Evan: Managing spot instances for cost savings led to preemptions; we mitigated with checkpointing and fallback to CPU nodes.
\[00:03:08] Bob: What recommendations do you give on GPU scaling?
\[00:03:11] Evan: Use a mix of reserved and spot GPUs, implement horizontal autoscaling based on queue length and latency targets, and optimize batch sizes dynamically.
\[00:03:31] Bob: Let’s shift to partnerships. How did you approach integrations with platforms?
\[00:03:36] Evan: We built a partnership team that negotiated access to YouTube Content ID API and TikTok’s developer program, offered co-marketing, and provided SDKs for easy plugin integration.
\[00:03:55] Bob: What made those partnerships successful?
\[00:03:58] Evan: Clear mutual value—our AI features improved publish speed, while their developer support gave us early API access and featured us in their marketplaces.
\[00:04:14] Bob: Can you share a specific partnership story?
\[00:04:17] Evan: Sure, we partnered with a major MCN to co-launch an auto-highlighter feature. They provided usage data, we optimized highlights, and they promoted us to their 10k creators—tripling our active users.
\[00:04:41] Bob: From a business model perspective, what worked?
\[00:04:44] Evan: A freemium model with premium AI features behind a paywall, and revenue sharing on referrals from partner marketplaces.
\[00:04:58] Bob: What challenges in creator monetization?
\[00:05:01] Evan: Balancing free usage to drive virality while converting power users to paid plans; we used usage caps and feature gating to push upgrades.
\[00:05:18] Bob: On developer relations, how did you structure outreach?
\[00:05:21] Evan: We created developer docs, sample apps, ran hackathons, and offered support tiers, ensuring high-touch support for key partners.
\[00:05:41] Bob: How important was community building?
\[00:05:44] Evan: Crucial. We ran a Slack community, hosted monthly AMAs, and seeded community contributions to our open-source inference SDK.
\[00:06:02] Bob: Let’s discuss product roadmap. How did you prioritize features?
\[00:06:06] Evan: Based on weighted scoring: user impact, engineering effort, alignment with partner goals, and potential revenue lift, reviewed weekly by PM and exec team.
\[00:06:28] Bob: What’s a feature you deprioritized that was tough to let go?
\[00:06:32] Evan: Real-time style transfer in live streams—tech was cool, but low demand and high compute cost, so we shelved it for future waves.
\[00:06:49] Bob: On funding, how many rounds and amounts?
\[00:06:51] Evan: We raised \$10M Series A in 2020, \$25M Series B in 2021, and pitched investors on path to acquisition in late 2021.
\[00:07:05] Bob: What were investor concerns?
\[00:07:07] Evan: Model performance versus cost, pathway to scale beyond core user base, and stickiness of creator workflows.
\[00:07:20] Bob: How did you address those?
\[00:07:22] Evan: We presented pilot ROI from MCN partners, detailed GPU cost per user metrics, and showed retention curves improving with new features.
\[00:07:41] Bob: Let’s cover team culture. How did you build culture in a remote-first team?
\[00:07:45] Evan: Weekly all-hands with live demos, virtual team-building, hack weeks, and clear documentation culture—folksonomy wikis and playbooks.
\[00:08:06] Bob: What were early hiring priorities?

\[00:14:06] Bob: Let’s talk revenue models. Did you explore usage-based pricing?
\[00:14:10] Evan: We evaluated pay-per-minute-of-processing pricing, but users preferred predictable subscriptions; we kept usage-based ancillaries for extra codecs.
\[00:14:31] Bob: On R\&D, what percent of budget?
\[00:14:34] Evan: We allocated 30% of revenue to R\&D to stay ahead on model improvements and integration features.
\[00:14:52] Bob: What was your biggest technical debt?
\[00:14:54] Evan: Early code spun up monolithic inference services; we refactored to microservices later but backlog was large.
\[00:15:12] Bob: How did you manage that refactoring?
\[00:15:14] Evan: We ran a six-month initiative, tied refactoring tasks to feature flags, and released in incremental slices to reduce risk.
\[00:15:33] Bob: On team growth, did you hire remotely or locally?
\[00:15:36] Evan: Mixed—core ML and infra in SF, front-end in Berlin, product in NYC. We used remote onboarding playbooks and annual meetups.
\[00:15:54] Bob: How did you handle time zones?
