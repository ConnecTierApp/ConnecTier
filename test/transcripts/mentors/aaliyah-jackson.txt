[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Aaliyah, thanks for speaking with me today. I’d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

[00:00:05] Aaliyah: Hey Bob, thanks for having me. I'm Aaliyah Jackson, a playwright and spoken word artist from New Orleans. I've been deeply involved in the underground art scenes for quite some time now.

[00:00:15] Bob: That's fantastic. Can you tell me more about your journey as a playwright and spoken word artist?

[00:00:20] Aaliyah: Sure thing. I grew up in New Orleans, a city rich in culture and history. I started writing poetry in high school, and it quickly became my passion. I performed at local open mics and eventually started writing plays. My work has been featured in various indie theatre productions across the U.S.

[00:00:40] Bob: That's impressive. How did you transition from performing arts to mentoring startups?

[00:00:45] Aaliyah: It was a bit of a serendipitous journey. A friend of mine who was involved in the tech startup scene reached out to me. They were struggling with their brand voice and needed someone who could help them craft a narrative that resonated emotionally with their audience. I stepped in, and the rest is history.

[00:01:05] Bob: That's a unique transition. What specific skills do you bring to the table for startups?

[00:01:10] Aaliyah: My expertise lies in language, rhythm, and emotional resonance. I understand how to structure narratives and how to engage live audiences. This translates well into crafting pitches, campaigns, or brand voices that are unforgettable. I help mission-driven teams connect deeply with people.

[00:01:30] Bob: That's valuable. Can you give an example of a startup you've worked with and how you helped them?

[00:01:35] Aaliyah: Absolutely. I worked with a startup that was developing an app to help local farmers connect directly with consumers. Their initial pitch was very tech-focused and lacked emotional appeal. I helped them reframe their story to highlight the human impact of their work—the struggles of farmers, the joy of fresh produce, and the community they were building. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and they saw a significant increase in user engagement.

[00:02:00] Bob: That's a great example. How do you approach reshaping a pitch or campaign?

[00:02:05] Aaliyah: First, I listen to the founders and understand their vision and values. Then, I dive into the audience they want to reach. I look at the emotional core of their message and find ways to amplify it. It's about making the story relatable and compelling, something that sticks with people long after they've heard it.

[00:02:30] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of translating complex tech ideas into emotionally resonant stories?

[00:02:35] Aaliyah: It's all about finding the human element. Every tech idea, no matter how complex, has a human impact. I focus on that impact and use it as the foundation for the story. For example, if a startup is developing AI for healthcare, I might focus on the stories of patients whose lives have been improved by the technology.

[00:03:00] Bob: That makes sense. How do you work with teams to ensure the narrative stays consistent across all touchpoints?

[00:03:05] Aaliyah: Consistency is key. I work closely with the team to develop a narrative framework that can be adapted to different platforms—whether it's a pitch to investors, a social media campaign, or a blog post. I also provide training and guidelines to ensure everyone on the team understands the narrative and can communicate it effectively.

[00:03:30] Bob: How do you measure the success of a narrative or campaign?

[00:03:35] Aaliyah: Success can be measured in various ways, depending on the goals of the startup. It could be increased user engagement, higher conversion rates, or positive feedback from investors. I also look at qualitative metrics, like the emotional response from the audience. If people are moved by the story and feel a deep connection to the brand, that's a sign of success.

[00:04:00] Bob: That's insightful. How do you stay updated with the latest trends in storytelling and audience engagement?

[00:04:05] Aaliyah: I stay connected to the indie theatre and poetry circles, as well as Black artist collectives and community radio. These networks are a rich source of inspiration and innovation. I also attend workshops and conferences to learn from other storytellers and marketers.

[00:04:30] Bob: How do you adapt your approach for different industries or audiences?

[00:04:35] Aaliyah: Every industry and audience has its unique characteristics. I do extensive research to understand the cultural context, the pain points, and the aspirations of the audience. This helps me tailor the narrative to resonate with them. For example, the approach for a healthcare startup would be different from that of a fintech startup.

[00:05:00] Bob: How do you handle feedback and iterations in the storytelling process?

[00:05:05] Aaliyah: Feedback is crucial. I encourage open communication with the team and the audience. I listen to their feedback and use it to refine the narrative. It's an iterative process—we test different versions of the story, gather feedback, and make adjustments until we find the version that resonates the most.

[00:05:30] Bob: How do you ensure that the narrative remains authentic to the startup's mission and values?

[00:05:35] Aaliyah: Authenticity is non-negotiable. I work closely with the founders to ensure that the narrative stays true to their mission and values. It's about finding the balance between emotional resonance and authenticity. If the story feels forced or inauthentic, it won't connect with the audience.

[00:06:00] Bob: How do you handle cultural sensitivity and inclusivity in your storytelling?

[00:06:05] Aaliyah: Cultural sensitivity and inclusivity are at the core of my work. I make sure to represent diverse voices and perspectives in the narrative. I also consult with cultural advisors to ensure that the story is respectful and inclusive. It's about creating a narrative that resonates with everyone, regardless of their background.

[00:06:30] Bob: How do you integrate visual and auditory elements into your storytelling?

[00:06:35] Aaliyah: Visual and auditory elements can enhance the emotional impact of a story. I work with designers and musicians to create visuals and soundscapes that complement the narrative. For example, a powerful image or a compelling soundtrack can make the story more immersive and memorable.

[00:07:00] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of maintaining the audience's attention in a digital age?

[00:07:05] Aaliyah: In the digital age, attention spans are short. I focus on creating concise and impactful narratives that can capture the audience's attention quickly. I also use multimedia elements to keep the audience engaged. It's about finding the right balance between brevity and depth.

[00:07:30] Bob: How do you adapt your storytelling for different platforms, like social media, blogs, or live events?

[00:07:35] Aaliyah: Each platform has its unique characteristics and audience expectations. I tailor the narrative to fit the platform. For social media, I focus on short, engaging content. For blogs, I provide more in-depth stories. For live events, I create immersive experiences that engage the audience in real-time.

[00:08:00] Bob: How do you handle the pressure of delivering a compelling narrative under tight deadlines?

[00:08:05] Aaliyah: Pressure can be a catalyst for creativity. I stay organized and prioritize tasks to meet deadlines. I also rely on my network of collaborators to help bring the narrative to life quickly. It's about staying focused and flexible.

[00:08:30] Bob: How do you ensure that the narrative remains fresh and innovative over time?

[00:08:35] Aaliyah: Innovation is key. I constantly seek new ideas and inspiration from various sources. I also encourage the team to experiment with different storytelling techniques and formats. It's about keeping the narrative dynamic and evolving with the audience's interests.

[00:09:00] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of storytelling in a competitive market where everyone is vying for attention?

[00:09:05] Aaliyah: In a competitive market, standing out is crucial. I focus on creating unique and authentic narratives that cut through the noise. I also leverage my networks in the indie theatre and poetry circles to bring fresh perspectives to the storytelling process.

[00:09:30] Bob: How do you integrate data and analytics into your storytelling process?

[00:09:35] Aaliyah: Data and analytics provide valuable insights into audience behavior and preferences. I use this information to refine the narrative and make it more effective. For example, if the data shows that a particular message resonates well with the audience, I focus on amplifying that message.

[00:10:00] Bob: How do you handle the ethical considerations of storytelling, especially when dealing with sensitive topics?

[00:10:05] Aaliyah: Ethical considerations are paramount. I ensure that the narrative is respectful and sensitive to the topics being addressed. I also consult with experts and stakeholders to ensure that the story is accurate and fair. It's about maintaining integrity and responsibility in storytelling.

[00:10:30] Bob: How do you measure the long-term impact of a narrative on the startup's brand and mission?

[00:10:35] Aaliyah: The long-term impact can be measured through sustained engagement and loyalty from the audience. I look at metrics like customer retention, brand advocacy, and the startup's overall growth. If the narrative continues to resonate and drive positive outcomes over time, it's a sign of long-term success.

[00:11:00] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of scaling a narrative as the startup grows?

[00:11:05] Aaliyah: Scaling a narrative requires a strategic approach. I work with the team to develop a scalable narrative framework that can adapt to the startup's growth. This includes creating guidelines, training materials, and tools that ensure the narrative remains consistent and impactful as the startup expands.

[00:11:30] Bob: How do you integrate user-generated content into your storytelling strategy?

[00:11:35] Aaliyah: User-generated content can enhance the authenticity and reach of the narrative. I encourage the audience to share their stories and experiences related to the startup. This not only amplifies the narrative but also builds a community around the brand.

[00:12:00] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of storytelling in a global market with diverse cultural backgrounds?

[00:12:05] Aaliyah: In a global market, cultural sensitivity is key. I work with local cultural advisors to ensure that the narrative resonates with diverse audiences. I also adapt the narrative to fit the cultural context of each market, ensuring that it remains authentic and impactful.

[00:12:30] Bob: How do you ensure that the narrative remains relevant and engaging over time?

[00:12:35] Aaliyah: Relevance and engagement are ongoing challenges. I stay updated with the latest trends and audience preferences. I also encourage the team to continuously innovate and experiment with new storytelling techniques. It's about keeping the narrative fresh and dynamic.

[00:13:00] Bob: How do you handle the challenge of storytelling in a crisis or challenging situation?

[00:13:05] Aaliyah: In a crisis, clear and empathetic communication is crucial. I work with the team to develop a crisis communication plan that addresses the situation honestly and compassionately. It's about maintaining transparency and building trust with the audience.

[00:13:30] Bob: How do you integrate feedback from the audience into your storytelling process?

[00:13:35] Aaliyah: Audience feedback is invaluable. I create channels for the audience to share their thoughts and experiences. I use this feedback to refine the narrative and make it more resonant. It's about creating a dialogue with the audience and ensuring that their voices are heard.
