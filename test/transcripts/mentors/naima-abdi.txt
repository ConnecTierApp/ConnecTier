[00:00:00] Bob: Hello Naima, thanks for speaking with me today. Iâ€™d like to learn about your background and how you mentor startups.

[00:00:05] Naima: Thanks for having me, Bob. I'm Naima Abdi, a Somali-born social entrepreneur and former UN innovation fellow. My focus has been on digital inclusion and mobile infrastructure in underserved regions.

[00:00:15] Bob: That's fantastic. Can you tell me more about your experience as a UN innovation fellow?

[00:00:18] Naima: Certainly. I joined the UN in 2015 and worked on various projects aimed at bridging the digital divide. One of our key initiatives was setting up last-mile internet access in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. We collaborated with local governments, NGOs, and tech companies to build sustainable infrastructure.

[00:00:40] Bob: That sounds like a significant challenge. What were some of the biggest obstacles you faced?

[00:00:43] Naima: The primary challenge was the lack of existing infrastructure. Many of these regions had no reliable electricity, let alone internet connectivity. We had to innovate with solar power solutions and low-cost satellite internet. Additionally, community engagement was crucial. We had to ensure that the technology we introduced was culturally appropriate and addressed the specific needs of the communities.

[00:01:10] Bob: How did you go about engaging the local communities in these projects?

[00:01:13] Naima: We adopted a community-driven product design approach. This involved extensive field research, focus groups, and co-creation workshops with the locals. For instance, in one project, we developed a digital identity system that allowed refugees to access essential services. The system was designed based on feedback from the refugees themselves, ensuring it was user-friendly and met their needs.

[00:01:40] Bob: That's impressive. Can you share more about the digital identity systems you've worked on?

[00:01:43] Naima: Absolutely. Digital identity systems are crucial for providing access to services like healthcare, education, and financial services. We developed a blockchain-based identity system that was secure, scalable, and could operate in low-connectivity environments. This system was piloted in refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, and it significantly improved the efficiency and transparency of service delivery.

[00:02:15] Bob: How did you ensure the security and privacy of the data in these systems?

[00:02:18] Naima: Security and privacy were top priorities. We used encryption and decentralized storage solutions to protect the data. Additionally, we implemented robust consent mechanisms to ensure that individuals had control over their data. We also conducted regular audits and worked with legal experts to comply with data protection regulations.

[00:02:50] Bob: That's comprehensive. Can you talk about any specific success stories or impactful projects you've been part of?

[00:02:53] Naima: One of the most impactful projects was the deployment of a mobile health platform in rural Tanzania. This platform allowed healthcare workers to collect and share patient data in real-time, even in areas with limited connectivity. We used a combination of SMS and low-bandwidth apps to make it accessible. The project resulted in a 30% increase in vaccination rates and improved maternal health outcomes.

[00:03:30] Bob: That's a tremendous achievement. How did you measure the impact of your projects?

[00:03:33] Naima: We used a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. For quantitative data, we tracked metrics like the number of users, service uptake, and changes in key health indicators. For qualitative data, we conducted interviews and surveys to understand the user experience and identify areas for improvement. We also worked with academic partners to conduct impact assessments and publish our findings.

[00:04:05] Bob: How do you stay updated with the latest technologies and trends in digital inclusion?

[00:04:08] Naima: I stay connected with various tech hubs and innovation labs in East Africa. I attend conferences, workshops, and webinars regularly. Additionally, I'm part of several online communities and forums where experts share their insights and experiences. I also read a lot of research papers and industry reports to stay informed.

[00:04:40] Bob: That's great. How do you approach mentoring startups in this field?

[00:04:43] Naima: When mentoring startups, I focus on a few key areas. First, I help them understand the unique challenges and opportunities in underserved regions. This includes cultural nuances, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory environments. Second, I guide them in designing products that are sustainable and scalable. This often involves iterative testing and feedback loops with the target communities.

[00:05:15] Bob: Can you give an example of a startup you've mentored and the outcomes of your guidance?

[00:05:18] Naima: Sure. I mentored a startup that was developing a mobile payment system for small farmers in Uganda. They initially struggled with user adoption because the system was too complex for the farmers. I advised them to simplify the user interface and integrate it with existing mobile money platforms. We also conducted user testing sessions in rural areas to gather feedback. As a result, they saw a 50% increase in user adoption within six months.

[00:05:55] Bob: That's a significant improvement. How do you help startups navigate the regulatory and policy landscapes in different regions?

[00:05:58] Naima: Navigating the regulatory landscape can be challenging, especially in regions with evolving policies. I help startups by connecting them with local experts and policymakers. I also advise them on best practices for compliance and data protection. In some cases, I've even facilitated partnerships with governments and NGOs to pilot their solutions in controlled environments.
